## ðŸ§  Key Features

* **Quantum-Inspired Approach**: The algorithm simulates imaginary-time evolution of a quantum state using tensor networks, allowing for efficient extraction of the optimal solution via partial trace.
* **Support for Multiple Optimization Classes**:

  * **QUBO**: Binary variables, quadratic cost function, tridiagonal structure.
  * **QUDO**: Discrete variables of arbitrary dimension.
  * **Tensor QUDO**: Cost function defined via a position-dependent tensor.
* **Polynomial-Time Execution**:

  * QUBO: $O(N^2)$ complexity
  * QUDO and Tensor QUDO: $O(N^2 D^2)$ complexity
* **Degeneracy Handling**: The algorithm is robust to degenerate ground states, and multiple optimal solutions can be extracted.
* **Explicit Equation**: Provides a closed-form tensor network contraction equation for each solution component.
* **Efficient Contractions**: Optimized contraction using MPO-like structure, including the Humbucker method for phase-cancelled state filtering.
